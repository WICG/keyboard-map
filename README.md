# keyboard-map

Draft specification for an API that returns a mapping table from `KeyboardEvent.code`
values into strings that can be shown to the user to identify that physical key.

See the [UI Events KeyboardEvent code Values](https://w3c.github.io/uievents-code/)
specification for background on `KeyboardEvent.code`.
